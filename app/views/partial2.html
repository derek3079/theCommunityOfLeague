How it works. Hard water enters the water softener system. As it passes throughout the resin bed inside the tank the hard water minerals are attracted and attach to the resin beads, leaving only softened water to service the home.

When the resin becomes saturated with hard water minerals, the water softener system automatically goes into regeneration. This is the process that frees the resin of hard water minerals, making it ready to soften the water again. Brine water is drawn into the resin tank and rinses the hard water minerals off the resin beads and down the drain. Once the resin is free of hard water minerals, fresh water rinses the remaining brine water out of the system leaving the system ready for service.
