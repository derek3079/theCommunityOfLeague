  In order to understand the benefits of soft water we need to understand how detrimental hard water can be.

  Hard water is water that contains a high concentration of dissolved minerals. Water is a solvent. Which means it is a liquid substance that dissolves other substances. Calcium and Magnesium are the most common minerals found in hard water.  Water picks these minerals up as it travels through soil and rock and suspends them until they end up in your water supply.

  Hard water affects almost all the cleaning tasks around the home. The Water Quality Association sponsored a study about the effect of hard water in several cleaning tasks. We will discuss below the benefits discovered. A study from Cornell University states, “The amount of hardness in your water affects the amount of soap and detergent necessary for cleaning. Clothes laundered in hard water may feel harsh and scratchy. Dishes and glasses may be spotted when dry. Hard water may cause a film on glass shower doors, shower walls, bathtubs, sinks, faucets, ect. Water flow may be reduced by deposits in pipes and shower heads. Faucets and other fixtures can have permanent deposits on them and the chrome finish can be destroyed.”

  The study done by the WQA showed that in a typical storage type water heater over 15 years would enjoy an almost 15% increase in efficiency as compared with a storage water heater that had 26 gpg hard water. The scale accumulation (see bottom of page) was dramatically reduced in the unit with soft water to 7 grams a year in comparison to the water heater being served by hard water at 528 grams a year.

  Ten low flow showerheads were tested. The showerheads were removed as they were not able to provide the amount of water they were rated for. 5 showerheads were supplied with hard water and 5 with soft water. The 5 supplied by soft water made it through the testing without problems. On the other hand the showerheads supplied by hard water failed after an average of 3,203 gallons.

  Ten low flow faucets were tested in similar fashion. 5 on hard water and 5 on soft water. The faucets supplied by soft water passed with out problem. The faucets supplied by hard water became clogged and experienced reduced flow after an average of 19 days at 50 gallons a day.

  Six dishwashers and laundry washers were test on performance. They ran 8 cycles every day. Clothes washers were loaded with 7 pounds of restaurant towels and dish washers with 8 place settings. After 30 days it was found that units using soft water were almost completely free of any scale build up and only required a quick wipe down. The units using hard water (26 grains per gallon) had noticeable scale build up on all interior surfaces and the washers needed to be delimed and cleaned.

  Detergent use was also tested. The savings in detergent use and energy use was very high. They found that even when half the detergent was used at a low temperature the washing yielded improved results when the softened water was used. Reduction of hardness is significantly more effective on stain removal than either increase in temperature or detergent dose. Depending on the stain, hardness reduction was up to 100 times more effective at stain removal. If softened water is used detergent should be reduced by at least 50%. 

  Detergent savings with automatic dishwashers were dramatic. The savings were up to 70% when using soft water over hard water. Statistically significant improvements were documented in spotting and filming performance as well as in better soil removal. Hardness reduction was 6 times more effective at reducing spotting and twice as effective at reducing filming as increasing dosage use.
